        <p><b><em>Do I have programming background?</em></b> No, but I am full aware that hard skill from college alone cant help me to get my dream job, i have to learn other skills in order to compete in the work industry, thus I enroll in this course in order to further increasing my skillsets. My goal after finishing this program is ofcourse I want to be able to make good web site, right now for the front-end at the very least. After that, I want to learn back-end development in order to be a better web developer.</p><div align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vd7vGbB.png" align="center"></div>
